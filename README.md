# LeaveRecords
This application allows for the annual leave of staff members to be monitored and documented. The default amount of leave for a staff member is 25 days, which can be changed. When a holiday is booked, the duration will be deducted from the amount remaining for that individual. This was created a few years ago, and still has a practical use for those who want a free and efficient service for what has been described above. The application was developed with an observer design pattern, meaning that lists will automatically be refreshed when a method is triggered on another form that targets a list on another (in this context). Any command can be undone, or redone by selecting the relevant buttons from the drop down menu; effectively akin to Microsoft Word.
